        <h1>The story of Sam's Super Sudoky Solver</h1>
        <h2>A little background on me...</h2>
        <p>
            I'm an aspiring front end developer. I have been a professional musician but have decided to pursue a fascination in programming. I started off teaching myself
            Python and most enjoyed recreating classic games like Snake, Tetris and Minesweeper. Then I discovered the excitement of working in React and creating beautiful web apps.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Sudoku?</h2>
        <p>
            I've always enjoyed a sudoku puzzle, and the logic behind solving one, and ever since learning to code making a sudoku solver was an ambition. After beginning to
            familiarise myself with Typescript I thought it would be a good first project to build with with a basic <b>HTML / CSS / Typescript</b> stack, and a good chance to test my core
            programming principles and algorithmic thinking.
        </p>
        <h2>How does your algorithm work?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm using the backtracking approach. Essentially; starting at the beginning of the puzzle, enter a number (starting at 1), check if it is valid with
            the rest of the puzzle, if it is, move on, if it isn't enter the next number. If you get to a number 9 and it still isn't valid, then move back a square 
            and try the next number in that box.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is quite an expensive algorithm, because you are looping over the grid, and the numbers in each square thousands of times. 
        </p>
        <h2>Do you think you'll improve the algorithm?</h2>
        <p>
            This is probably the most complex algorithm I have worked on. It was challenging at times but I'm proud of it. That being said, I'm planning to keep working on it to 
            find how and where I can improve the algorithm, which I will then upload as a version 2.
